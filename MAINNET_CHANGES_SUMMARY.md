# Mainnet Changes Summary

## ‚úÖ Changes Completed

### 1. **Environment Configuration System**
- Created `/config/environment.ts` with development, staging, and production configurations
- Centralized all environment-specific settings
- Added feature flags for demo content, logging, and mock mode
- Configured mainnet Solana cluster and RPC URLs

### 2. **Solana Network Updates**
- Updated `walletConnectors.ts` to use environment-based cluster configuration
- Changed from hardcoded `'solana:devnet'` to `config.solanaCluster`
- App identity now uses environment-specific app name and URL

### 3. **Demo Content Control**
- Modified `GameContext.tsx` to conditionally load sample games based on `config.showDemoContent`
- Updated `GamesView.tsx` to respect the demo content flag
- Modified home screen to conditionally show demo instructions

### 4. **Production Logging**
- Logger already configured to disable logging in production
- Only errors will be logged in production environment

### 5. **Age Gate & Compliance**
- Created `AgeGate.tsx` component for age verification (18+)
- Added terms of service and privacy policy acceptance
- Integrated financial risk warnings for wagering
- Age gate appears on first launch in production

### 6. **Game Wager Limits**
- Updated `GameSelectionModal.tsx` to use environment-based wager limits
- Min wager: 10 ALLY (production), 1 ALLY (development)
- Max wager: 1000 ALLY (production), 10000 ALLY (development)

### 7. **Production Environment Files**
- Created `.env.production` template with all required variables
- Created `MAINNET_CHECKLIST.md` for launch preparation

## üöÄ Ready for Production

The app is now configured to switch between environments based on the `EXPO_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT` variable:

```bash
# Development
EXPO_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT=development npm start

# Production
EXPO_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT=production npm start
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Tasks

### Before Mainnet Launch:

1. **Set Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.production .env
   # Edit .env with actual values:
   # - EXPO_PUBLIC_HELIUS_API_KEY
   # - EXPO_PUBLIC_ALLY_TOKEN_ADDRESS (when deployed)
   # - EXPO_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN (optional)
   ```

2. **Update app.json**
   - Update version numbers
   - Add privacy policy URL
   - Add terms of service URL
   - Update bundle identifiers

3. **Backend Configuration**
   - Ensure backend is using mainnet RPC
   - Update CORS origins for production
   - Enable rate limiting
   - Configure proper JWT expiry

4. **Test on Mainnet**
   - Test Seed Vault connection with mainnet
   - Test with real ALLY tokens
   - Verify all transactions work correctly

5. **App Store Submission**
   - Build production binaries
   - Prepare screenshots
   - Write app descriptions
   - Submit for review

## üîí Security Considerations

1. **No Private Keys**: App never handles private keys
2. **Wallet Signatures**: All auth via wallet message signing
3. **Age Verification**: Required for wagering compliance
4. **Wager Limits**: Enforced to prevent excessive gambling
5. **Production Logging**: Minimal logging to prevent data leaks

## üì± Building for Production

```bash
# Install EAS CLI if not already installed
npm install -g eas-cli

# Build for production
eas build --platform all --profile production

# Submit to stores
eas submit --platform ios
eas submit --platform android
```

## üéØ Post-Launch Monitoring

1. Monitor error logs for issues
2. Track user registrations
3. Monitor game creation/completion rates
4. Check transaction success rates
5. Review app store feedback

The app is now mainnet-ready with proper environment separation, compliance features, and production-safe configurations!
