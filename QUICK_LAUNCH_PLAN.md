# Korus Quick Launch Plan (Without Smart Contracts)

## Option 1: Soft Launch with Manual Transactions

### How It Works:
1. Users connect wallets for authentication only
2. Display "Coming Soon" for wagering features
3. Focus on social features first
4. Implement tipping as direct P2P transfers

### Implementation:
```typescript
// Simple P2P tipping without escrow
async function sendTip(recipient: string, amount: number) {
  // User manually sends SOL via wallet
  // Backend tracks the transaction
  const tx = await wallet.sendTransaction(...)
  await backend.recordTip(tx.signature)
}
```

### Timeline: Launch in 1-2 days

## Option 2: Custodial Wallet System

### How It Works:
1. Create a backend-controlled wallet
2. Users deposit funds to play
3. Backend manages all transactions
4. Users can withdraw anytime

### Pros:
- Full game functionality immediately
- No smart contract needed
- Complete control over game logic

### Cons:
- Centralized (not ideal for crypto users)
- Requires trust
- Regulatory considerations

### Timeline: Launch in 3-5 days

## Option 3: Hybrid Approach (Recommended)

### Phase 1: Social Features Only (Launch Now)
- Wallet authentication ✓
- Create posts ✓
- Like/comment ✓
- NFT avatars ✓
- Direct tipping (P2P)

### Phase 2: Add Games (2-4 weeks)
- Deploy smart contracts
- Integrate escrow system
- Enable wagering
- Full decentralization

### Benefits:
- Launch immediately
- Build user base
- Test core features
- Add games when contracts ready

## Immediate Action Items:

### For Soft Launch (Option 3):
1. Update UI to show "Games Coming Soon"
2. Enable P2P tipping
3. Create waitlist for game features
4. Launch to Solana dApp Store
5. Start smart contract development

### Code Changes Needed:
```typescript
// Add to GameSelectionModal.tsx
{config.isProduction && !config.smartContractsEnabled && (
  <View style={styles.comingSoon}>
    <Text>Wagered games launching soon!</Text>
    <Text>Join the waitlist</Text>
  </View>
)}

// Add to config
smartContractsEnabled: false, // Toggle when ready
```

## Decision Required:
Which approach would you prefer?

1. **Soft Launch** - Social only, games later
2. **Custodial** - Full features, centralized
3. **Wait** - Delay launch for contracts

Most Solana apps start with option 1 or 2 and decentralize over time.
