# üöÄ Korus Backend Implementation Plan

## Overview
This document outlines the comprehensive plan for implementing the backend functionality and connecting it to the Korus frontend application.

## Current State Assessment

### ‚úÖ What's Already Built
- **Backend Framework**: Express.js with TypeScript
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth with Solana wallet support (mocked)
- **API Structure**: RESTful endpoints for posts, replies, interactions
- **Database Schema**: Complete models for users, posts, replies, interactions

### ‚ö†Ô∏è What's Partially Implemented
- **Solana Integration**: Wallet signature verification (currently mocked)
- **Genesis Token Verification**: Placeholder implementation
- **Tip System**: Balance updates without blockchain transactions
- **Bump System**: Functional but needs testing with real data

### ‚ùå What's Missing
- **Frontend-Backend Connection**: No API integration in frontend
- **Real Authentication**: Mocked signature verification
- **Media Upload**: No image/video storage system
- **Notifications**: Schema exists but no implementation
- **Game Integration**: No backend support for games
- **Real Blockchain Transactions**: All on-chain operations are mocked

```json
{
  "socket.io": "^4.x",
  "multer": "^1.x",
  "sharp": "^0.x",
