# Korus Reputation Score System (Backend Service)

## Overview
The Korus Reputation Score (KRS) is a backend-only scoring system that silently tracks user contributions and engagement on the platform. This score is calculated and stored internally for:
- Fair ranking of users
- Determining future airdrop allocations
- Qualifying users for special features
- Community governance weight

**Note**: This is a backend calculation system only. There are no UI components or user-facing pages for reputation scores.

## Anti-Gaming Measures

1. **Diminishing Returns**: Repeated actions have decreasing value
2. **Quality Filters**: Low-quality content receives minimal points
3. **Time Delays**: Actions must be spaced out to count
4. **Engagement Ratios**: Balanced activity required
5. **Sybil Protection**: One account per wallet enforced

## Airdrop Calculation

```
Airdrop Share = (User KRS / Total Platform KRS) √ó Airdrop Pool √ó Tier Multiplier
```
