## üìã Pre-Deployment Steps

### Environment Variables Required

#### Frontend (.env)
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://your-backend.render.com
EXPO_PUBLIC_SOLANA_NETWORK=mainnet-beta
EXPO_PUBLIC_ALLY_TOKEN_ADDRESS=<token_address>
EXPO_PUBLIC_HELIUS_API_KEY=<api_key>
```

#### Backend (.env)
```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://...
JWT_SECRET=<generate-secure-secret>
CSRF_SECRET=<generate-secure-secret>
NODE_ENV=production
```

### Deployment Commands

#### Backend (Render)
```bash
cd korus-backend
git push origin main
# Render auto-deploys from main branch
```

#### Frontend (Vercel)
```bash
git push origin main
# Vercel auto-deploys from main branch
```

## üöÄ Post-Deployment

### Monitoring
1. Enable Sentry error tracking
   - Frontend: npm install @sentry/react-native
   - Backend: npm install @sentry/node
   - Add SENTRY_DSN to environment variables

2. Set up monitoring for:
   - API response times
   - Database performance
   - Error rates
   - User analytics

### Performance Optimizations (Future)
- [ ] Image optimization with CDN
- [ ] Bundle size optimization
- [ ] Database query optimization
- [ ] Caching strategy implementation

## ‚ú® Ready for Production

The application has been thoroughly tested and prepared for production deployment. All critical issues have been resolved, and the codebase is stable.
